            <p>The druids of the Circle of Remembrance believes that no living being deserves to be forgotten. They spend most of their lives living the past, walking the memories and tasting the emotions of creatures they never met. Some of the memories are from the long dead, but the intensity of their emotions are so powerful that they linger even after any other remnant of their being is long gone.</p>
            <p class="indent">These memories can affect the druid deeply, often making them sullen and later alienated, as their mood changes harshly from day to day. Sometimes they are seen as judges, able to see past facades and see what is real and true.</p>

As an action you can choose; anguish, despair, or hope, and an unoccupied 5-foot square within 15 feet of you.
