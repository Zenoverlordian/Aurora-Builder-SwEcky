        <description>
    <p>With a quasit sitting on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p>
    <p class="indent">As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with abyssal powers.</p>
    <p class="indent">Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p>
    <p class="indent">Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p>
    <h4>SWORN AND BEHOLDEN</h4>
    <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.</p>
    <p class="indent">The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p>
    <h4>DELVERS INTO SECRETS</h4>
    <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p>
    <p class="indent">Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p>
    <p class="indent">Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A WARLOCK</h4>
    <p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p>
    <p class="indent">Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p>
    <p class="indent">What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p>
    <p class="indent">How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a chained companion, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the thaumaturgy and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells charm person and armor of Agathys.</p>

            <h5>BESTOWED SPELLS</h5>
            <p>Each patron has a list of associated spells-its bestowed spells-you gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the patron description. Once you gain a bestowed spell, you always know it, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you know.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you gain a spell that doesn’t appear on the warlock spell list, the spell is nonetheless a warlock spell for you.</p>

            <p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the warlock spell list.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>

            <p>Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize- like all power- comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your patron could be vampire, lich, or another being who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life.</p>

            <p>You choose an area of dim light or darkness that you can see within range and that fits within a 20-foot cube. Each creature within the area must succeed on Strength saving throw or be restrained by shadows until the spell ends.

            <p>You conjure three barbed harpoons of intricately twisted silver, which float in the air above your head for the spell’s duration.

            <p class="indent">If you hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and the harpoon lodges in their flesh. For each harpoon lodged inside a creature, its speed is reduced by 5 feet and you can use a bonus action to pull the creature 10 feet towards you. The target can use an action to pull any number of harpoons out, taking 2d6 necrotic damage for each harpoon removed and causing the harpoon to fade. Once all three harpoons have faded, the spell ends.</p>

            <p>Choose a creature that you can see within range. If the target can see you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d6 cold damage and is paralyzed until the end of your next turn unless it is immune to cold damage. The paralysis ends early if the creature takes damage or if the spell ends. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. When the paralysis ends, the target is frightened of you for the duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of its turns, the frightened target can make another Wisdom saving throw, which is made with disadvantage if it can see you. On a success, the effect ends.</p>
