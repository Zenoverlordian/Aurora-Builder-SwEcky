        <description>
            <p>Not much is known about the Circle of the Forgotten since they tend to keep to the darkest corners of nature, usually seen wandering alone. Druids of this circle are disconnected from the regular life most live, often finding themselves bonding with the millions of unseen lives they protect. Those who have come upon such a druid often feel uncomfortable speaking about it, sometimes even downright fearful of mentioning the druid's name.</p>
            <p class="indent">What little is known is that they use insects to control their enemies and aid their allies. The swarms they control moves with a singular mind and with a dangerous intellect.</p>
