            <p>Druids who are members of the Circle of the Courts hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. These druids seek to fill the world with wonders which are beyond the Material Plane.</p>
            <p class="indent">To succeed in this they must successfully manage the fey, creatures who are both fickle and dangerous. Fey are often divided into Seelie and Unseelie, light and dark, summer and winter, but that doesn't mean one is more evil than the other. Both are just as prone to cause terror as they are to bring joy since they are both unpredictable and hard to please.</p>
