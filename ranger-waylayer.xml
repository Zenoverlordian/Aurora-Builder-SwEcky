            <p>Knowing that a ranger of the Waylayer conclave is after you is one of the worst feelings imaginable. Everything around you can be another trap or trick to get you where they need you. A few targets even turn themselves in, as soon as the rumor starts spreading. Others do their best to trap their hunter, though more often than not find themselves being the one without a way out. The few who get past the traps, often believe they can best them in martial combat, where they swiftly realize their final mistake.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you've learned how to quickly craft temporary traps to hinder your foes. When you cast a spell that is from your Conclave spell list, you don't cast it as normal, you instead make it a trap. When you do so, the spell slot is expended, but the spell is not activated as you plant the trap at a point within 5 feet of you. You must have your Tinker's tools on you to be able to use this ability. You can use an action to remove a trap, while within 10 feet of it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell activates when a Small or larger creature other than you moves within 5 feet of it. If the spell got an area of effect, it is centered upon the trap. If it targets a creature, it targets the creature who triggered it. If it targets multiple creatures, they must all be within 10 feet of the creature who triggered it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can have one active trap at a time and it lasts for 1 hour. You can have an additional trap active when you reach 5th (2), 9th (3), 13th (4), and 17th level (5) in this class. If a spell requires concentration, you can ignore it, but you can only have one such trap active at a time. If you plant an additional trap when you have the max amount active, the oldest trap is destroyed. You cannot plant a trap within 10 feet of a creature or another trap.</p>
            <p class="indent">A trap is hidden but can be found with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check versus the ranger's spell save DC made within 10 feet of the trap and disarmed with a successful Dexterity (Thieves' tools) checks versus the ranger's spell save DC) made within 10 feet of the trap. On a failed disarm check, the trap triggers. If you create a trap in front of someone, they know that it is dangerous.</p>
