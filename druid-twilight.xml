        <description>
            <p>The circle of twilight is compromised of druids who wish to be a part of not only the world they live in, but also the ethereal world that remains a mystery to so many. The members of this circle focus on making amends between spirits and the world. To be alone among spirits is extremely dangerous and this is why the members of this circle participate in many rituals to discover their personal spirit guide.</p>
            <p class="indent">A spirit guide can take many shapes, sometimes as ethereal animals, others as incorporeal wisps, or simply as balls of light. These creatures guide the druids on their journey among the spirits of the deceased, however, they are not the only spirits which walk beside the druid.</p>
