            <p>As much part of nature, as nature are part of them, these rangers spend their lives tending to nature. Covered in vines, some of them protect sacred groves, while others track down and hunt creatures who seek to despoil nature. A few of them have spent so many years in the wild, they barely remember what lives they lived or what friends they had a lifetime ago.</p>
