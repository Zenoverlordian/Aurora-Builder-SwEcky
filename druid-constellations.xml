            <p>Beginning at 14th level, the moon protects you wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the power of the moon to guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.</p>
            <p class="indent">While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames or magic in the sphere (a campfire, dancing lights spell, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it. The upper part of the sphere shows a replica of the night sky, even if the sky is otherwise hidden.</p>
            <p class="indent">The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, as long as you are under the night sky, you can ignore the material cost of the divination spell.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 18th level, you have become a legend of your own and the cosmos has seen fit to immortalize you among the stars. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your motes use d8's instead of d4's, and whenever you use a mote on a target other than yourself, you are healed for half the amount of damage dealt or healing given.</li>
                <li>When you consume the motes, you can divide the damage and healing as you see fit. For example, with 6 motes you can heal a friendly creature for 4d8 while dealing 2d8 to an enemy creature.</li>
                <li>When you roll for initiative, you gain 6 motes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can change your attuned constellations when you finish a short rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You call forth a swarm of magical darts of glowing force, which swirl around you as they move with you. Each time a creature that you can see ends its turn within range, you can have a single dart fly forth and unerringly strike them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, as part of casting this spell and as an action on your turn you cause up to 6 darts to fly forth and strike a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target and is considered a magic missile for effects such as the shield spell. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot above 5th each time you use an action on your turn to cause darts to fly forth.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is magical darkness, which means that darkvision can't see through it.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.</p>
            <p class="indent">If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of the same level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius increases 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.</p>
